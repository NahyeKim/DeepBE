The levels of Cas9 and base editor variant proteins Western blotting showed that the levels of most Cas9 and base editor variant proteins were comparable except that NG-ABE8e(V106W) showed statistically significant higher protein levels than three YE1-BE4max variants (NG-YE1-BE4max, SpRY-YE1-BE4max, NRCH- YE1-BE4max) and two APOBEC-nCas9-Ung variants (NG-APOBEC-nCas9-Ung, NRCH-APOBEC-nCas9-Ung) as shown below. <br/><br/>

Western blot analysis of Cas9 protein levels in cells expressing Cas9 variants, base editor variants with different deaminases, and base editor variants containing Cas9 variants. The results from three independent western blot analyses are presented (n = 3). Error bars show mean ± s.e.m. Subsets of variants without statistically significant differences (P > 0.05, analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s post hoc test) in their protein levels are indicated by letters, such as a and b.
